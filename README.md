## :hammer: NodeJs

<img alt="style image" src="https://walde.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/nodejs_logo.png" width="200px">

```bash
> yarn init > yarn add chalk@2.4.2 commander@2.19.0 figlet@1.2.1 inquirer@6.2.2 shelljs@0.8.3 cli-table@0.3.1
```

## About
As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications. In the following "hello world" example, many connections can be handled concurrently. Upon each connection, the callback is fired, but if there is no work to be done, Node.js will sleep.

## API
The API reference documentation provides detailed information about a function or object in Node.js. This documentation indicates what arguments a method accepts, the return value of that method, and what errors may be related to that method. It also indicates which methods are available for different versions of Node.js.

## :hammer: MongoDB

```

## About
MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database management program. NoSQL is used as an alternative to traditional relational databases. NoSQL databases are quite useful for working with large sets of distributed data. MongoDB is a tool that can manage document-oriented information, store or retrieve information.

## About
The Robo 3T (formerly Robomongo) tool has been acquired by 3T Software Labs, the creators of the MongoDB client Studio 3T (formerly MongoChef).

3T will continue development of Robo 3T in parallel with its own MongoDB GUI and the good news is that it will be making Robo 3T free for all users from now on. This is an exciting new step for Robo 3T and its community, which will benefit users and the wider MongoDB ecosystem.
